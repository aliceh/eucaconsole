        <h5 class="title">Create a Volume</h5>
        <p> Eucalyptus offers persistent storage that you can attach to a
            running instance. These elastic block storage (EBS) volumes persist
            autonomously from the running life of an instance. After you attach a
            block volume to an instance, you can use it like any other physical hard
            drive.
        </p>
        <p>Add the details of your new volume:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Type the name of your volume in the <strong>Name</strong> textbox.</li>
            <li>If you would like to create a volume from an existing snapshot, select the snapshot from the
                <strong>Create from snapshot?</strong> drop-down listbox.
            </li>
            <li>Enter the size of the volume in gigabytes in the <strong>Volume Size (GB)</strong> text box.
                <p><strong>Note:</strong>
                    If you're creating a volume from a snapshot, you
                    can't enter a volume size that's smaller than the
                    original snapshot you've selected.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Select an availability zone from the <strong>Availability Zone</strong> drop-down list box.
                <p><strong>Note:</strong>
                    You can only attach a volume to an instance in the same availability zone.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
